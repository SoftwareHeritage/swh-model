    - author_date
    - committer
    - committer_date
    - extra_headers or metadata -> extra_headers

    A revision's identifier is the 'git'-checksum of a commit manifest

        <key> <encoded value>
        [end for each extra_headers]

        <message>

    The directory identifier is the ascii representation of its hexadecimal
    encoding.

    Author and committer are formatted using the :attr:`Person.fullname` attribute only.
    Dates are formatted with the :func:`format_offset` function.

    Extra headers are an ordered list of [key, value] pairs. Keys are strings
    and get encoded to utf-8 for identifier computation. Values are either byte
    strings, unicode strings (that get encoded to utf-8), or integers (that get
    encoded to their utf-8 decimal representation).

    Multiline extra header values are escaped by indenting the continuation
    lines with one ascii space.

    If the message is None, the manifest ends with the last header. Else, the
    message is appended to the headers after an empty line.

    The checksum of the full manifest is computed using the 'commit' git object
    type.

    Snapshots are a set of named branches, which are pointers to objects at any
    level of the Software Heritage DAG.

    As well as pointing to other objects in the Software Heritage DAG, branches
    can also be *alias*es, in which case their target is the name of another
    branch in the same snapshot, or *dangling*, in which case the target is
    unknown (and represented by the ``None`` value).

    A snapshot identifier is a salted sha1 (using the git hashing algorithm
    with the ``snapshot`` object type) of a manifest following the algorithm:

    1. Branches are sorted using the name as key, in bytes order.

    2. For each branch, the following bytes are output:

      - the type of the branch target:

        - ``content``, ``directory``, ``revision``, ``release`` or ``snapshot``
          for the corresponding entries in the DAG;
        - ``alias`` for branches referencing another branch;
        - ``dangling`` for dangling branches

      - an ascii space (``\\x20``)
      - the branch name (as raw bytes)
      - a null byte (``\\x00``)
      - the length of the target identifier, as an ascii-encoded decimal number
        (``20`` for current intrinsic identifiers, ``0`` for dangling
        branches, the length of the target branch name for branch aliases)
      - a colon (``:``)
      - the identifier of the target object pointed at by the branch,
        stored in the 'target' member:

        - for contents: their *sha1_git*
        - for directories, revisions, releases or snapshots: their intrinsic
          identifier
        - for branch aliases, the name of the target branch (as raw bytes)
        - for dangling branches, the empty string

      Note that, akin to directory manifests, there is no separator between
      entries. Because of symbolic branches, identifiers are of arbitrary
      length but are length-encoded to avoid ambiguity.

    Args:
      snapshot (dict): the snapshot of which to compute the identifier. A
        single entry is needed, ``'branches'``, which is itself a :class:`dict`
