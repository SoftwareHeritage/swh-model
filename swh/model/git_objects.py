"""
Converts SWH model objects to git(-like) objects

Most of the functions in this module take as argument an object from
:mod:`swh.model.model`, and format it like a git object.

They are the inverse functions of those in :mod:`swh.loader.git.converters`,
but with extensions, as SWH's model is a superset of Git's:

* extensions of existing types (eg. revision/commit and release/tag dates
  can be expressed with precision up to milliseconds, to support formatting
  Mercurial objects)
* new types, for SWH's specific needs (:class:`swh.model.model.RawExtrinsicMetadata`
  and :class:`swh.model.model.ExtID`)
* support for somewhat corrupted git objects that we need to reproduce

This is used for two purposes:

* Format manifests that can be hashed to produce :ref:`intrinsic identifiers
  <persistent-identifiers>`
* Write git objects to reproduce git repositories that were ingested in the archive.

    $StrWithoutSpaces is an ASCII string, and may not contain spaces.

    Newlines in $Bytes are escaped as with other git fields, ie. by adding a
    space after them.

    The extid_version line is only generated if the version is non-zero.
